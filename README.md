A Javascript file that contains a function that is linked to your HTML button and should:
grab the current date and time when the button is pressed and display it in console message AND a browser alert
Note, some methods for grabbing time stamps in Javascript will return the date in Unix time (ie 1546588220446), you will need to parse this into a human readable timestamp. For example, Jan 03 2019 23:50:20 . Both values are the same time. 

To setup your github pages account to serve your content, follow the instructions at pages.github.com (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

Your GitHub repository should contain the 3 files listed above as well as a ReadMe.md file that includes a link to the page. Your submitted repo should resemble this: http://bobmcherry.github.io
